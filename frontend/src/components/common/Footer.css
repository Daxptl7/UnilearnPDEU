    /* The wireframe shows a bottom line, wait, it says "About Support Legalities" inside a box at the bottom? The bottom box is "Professors... Top Companies... About Support Legalities" inside one big container? 
  Looking closely at wireframe: 
  The "Professors" box seems separate from the "About Support Legalities" row.
  The wireframe shows a line separating Top Companies and the footer links "About Support Legalities".
  Actually, looking at the very bottom of the image, there is a container with "About ... Support ... Legalities" inside the large bottom card? Or separate?
  "Professors" is in a big box.
  "Top Companies..." is inside that box.
  Then a line.
  Then "About Support Legalities".
  It looks like "About, Support, Legalities" are the footer items.
  I will style it as a simple footer bar for now, matching the clean wireframe look.
